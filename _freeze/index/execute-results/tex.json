In @sec-within-change, we look at how the service civique has changed the volunteers' attitudes and views? We then look at several outcomes of interest in detail, namely whether volunteers end their contract early (@sec-rupture), how satisfied they are (@sec-satisfaction), and how confident they are about their future? (@sec-perception-avenir). For these outcomes, we analyze whether there are trends across the different cohorts, and which demographic variables predict them. In @sec-programs we investigate differences between different programs offered by Cité Unis. The report ends with a brief conclusion on methodological notes for future questionnaires. \n\nFor these analyses, we rely on questionnaires collected by Cité Unis for four different cohorts of volunteers who did their service civique for a year (2020-2021; 2021-2022; 2022-2023; 2023-2024). These questionnaires are very extensive. For the present analyses, we selected a subset of key questions (a full list can be found in the [codebook](codebook.qmd))^[Note that, in the process of writing this report, this selection of variables was based only on the questionnaire of the first cohort (2020/21). As a result, potentially interesting variables that only appear in later questionnaires will not appear here.]. \n\nBefore diving into the results, a note on caution in interpreting the results presented in is report: Whenever we speak of \"predictions\", that simply means statistical associations---mere observations of differences between groups. This report does **not** provide any evidence that would warrant causal conclusions---answers as to **why** we observe these differences. \n\nBecause the data underlying this report is observational and---for most of it---does not allow to track opinion change (because most questions have only been asked once per cohort), the main objective of this report is not to provide specific and definitive answers. Instead, the aim is to allow Cité Unis to identify interesting questions. The numeric results presented here can act as pointers, but are not problem diagnoses. They always need to be accompanied by qualitative assessments of *why* we observe certain differences, and what could or could not be done about them. \n\nThis report is meant to inform by figures: the text passages do not discuss all the results from the figures. The text is mostly intended to provide guidance---to illustrate how to interpret the figures. The examples for these illustrations are mostly picked at random.\n\n# Who are the volunteers ? {#sec-who}\n\nIn this section, we review some demographic variables in detail. An extensive summary table with sample demographics across the different cohorts can be found in [Tables](tables.qmd). \n\n## Geographic location\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nVolunteers came from 80 different departments (see @fig-map-repartition). On average, across the different cohorts, most volunteers came from Bouches-du-Rhône (n = 404), followed by Nord (n = 350) and Seine-Saint-Denis (n = 316). \n\nOverall, there has been a steady increase in volunteers, from 6386 in 20-21 to 7848 in 23-24, and an average increase of 490.4 per year. Since the 20-21 cohort, each departement has on average increased by 26.7. There were 51 departements who saw an increase, and 14 who saw a decrease (see @fig-map-trend). For details on the trend of each departement, see [Tables](tables.qmd). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Répartition des volontaires en France à travers le temps.](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-map-repartition-1.pdf){#fig-map-repartition}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Evolution de recrutement pour la promo de 2023-24 par rapport à 2020-21.](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-map-trend-1.pdf){#fig-map-trend}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Age\n\nAs shown in @fig-age, across all promos, the majority of volunteers is between 18 and 20 years old.

Attrition can can have many causes. Here we distinguish between two explanations: ruptures, i.e. volonteers ending their service civique early (@sec-rupture) and survey fatigue, i.e. volunteers who continue their service civique but do not fill out the questionnaires (@fig-attrition-norupture). \n\n@fig-attrition shows attrition generally, while @fig-attrition-norupture excludes ruptures, thereby giving an estimate of survey fatigue. This latter figure shows that survey fatigue is an issue, but also suggests that there is a slightly positive trend towards reduced survey fatigue: more and more volunteers seem to answering the questionnaires at least for the first two questionnaires (q1 and q2), but less so for the third questionnaire (q3). \n\n\n::: {#fig-attrition .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(absolute numbers)](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-attrition-1.pdf){#fig-attrition-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(percentages)](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-attrition-2.pdf){#fig-attrition-2}\n:::\n\nNumber of volunteers per survey time point.

Note that in the percentage plot, the percentages are relative to all volunteers from the respective promo.\n:::\n\n\n## Voting {#sec-vote}\n\nIn this section, we look at how volunteers have changed regarding their voting behavior. Voting behavior was measured with the question: \"Avez-vous voté lors des dernières élections (locales ou nationales) ?\", which has been asked at time points q1 and q2. @fig-vote_derniers_elections-overview shows that, averaged across all cohorts and time points, the majority of volunteers reports having voted.\n\n\n::: {#fig-vote_derniers_elections-overview .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(absolute numbers)](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-vote_derniers_elections-overview-1.pdf){#fig-vote_derniers_elections-overview-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(percentages)](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-vote_derniers_elections-overview-2.pdf){#fig-vote_derniers_elections-overview-2}\n:::\n\nDistribution of whether volunteers reported having voted or not during the last elections, averaged across time points and cohorts.\n\n:::\n\n\n\nIn the following sections, we investigate how volunteers have changed in answering this question, throughout their service civique. For these analyses, we only consider those volunteers who have answered the question at both time points, q1 and q2. Changes towards \"Yes\" or \"No\" can have happened either from the respective other option, or from the third answer option: \"Vous n'aviez pas l'âge de voter ou vous n'étiez pas inscrit.e sur les listes électorales\", which is abbreviated in the plots below as \"Pas sur les listes\". We look at the different cohorts separately (promo 2020-21, @fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020; promo 2021-22, @fig-vote_derniers_elections-2021; 2022-23, @fig-vote_derniers_elections-2022; 2023-24, @fig-vote_derniers_elections-2023). \n\nThe following sections reveal considerable differences between the cohorts. For example, in 2020-21 and 2021-22, many volunteers reported changes in voting behavior, but in opposite directions: In 2020-21, 24% of volunteers changed towards \"No\", outweighing those who changed to \"Yes\" (6%) by far. Inversely, in 2021-22, 35% of volunteers changed towards \"Yes\", while only 8% changed towards \"No\".\n\nIt is not clear why we observe these differences. One explanation might be that volunteers care more about national elections than local ones (or vice verse). If that is the case, we would expect changes in voting behavior to be dependent on whether there were national or local elections happening during the year of a cohort's service civique.\n\n### Promo 2020-21\n\n\n::: {#fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020 .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Alluvial plot](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020-1.pdf){#fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Percentages](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020-2.pdf){#fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020-2}\n:::\n\nPromo 2020-21.

Note that this analysis considers only answers of volunteers who answered either yes or no at *both* time points.\n:::\n\n\n### Which demographic factors are associated with change of voting intentions? \n\n@fig-vote-change-model shows how different demographic variables predict changes in voting behavior. For this analysis, we look at all cohorts together. The outcome, changes in voting behavior, is binary (changed to no vs. changed to yes)^[I.e. ignoring all volunteers who did not change]. \n\nPlotted on the y-axis are the demographic variables, taken to predict change in voting behavior. For each categorical demographic variable, different levels are shown. For example, for the variable `age_category`, the plot shows three levels: `age_categorie18-20`, `age_categorie21-23`, `age_categorie24-30`. Each of these categories has an estimate (x-axis). These estimates are the results logistic regressions^[For each variable, a separate logistic regression has been run. The estimates from the logistic regression are exponantiated, so that the reported estimates can be interpreted as odds ratios (ORs).]. They indicate how being part of a certain category (e.g. being between 18 and 20 years old) predicts the chances of changing one's voting behavior. The estimates are \"odds ratios\", which can be conceived of as probabilities: An odds ratio of 1 means that this group has the same chance changing to \"no\" as changing to \"yes\". More than 1 means that this group is more likely to change to \"yes\". For example, an odds ratio of 2.0 means twice as likely. Less than 1 means that this group is more likely to change to \"no\". An odds ratio of 0.5 means half as likely. \n\nFor each categorical variable, one category is chosen as the baseline (or reference) category. The odds ratios of all other categories are relative to that baseline. For example, for the variable `age_category`, the category \"16-17\" is not appearing in the graph, because it is the (invisible) baseline category. If the odds ratio for `age_category18–20` is 1.43, this means that 18 to 20 year-olds are more likely to change their vote towards \"Yes\", compared to 16 to 17 year-olds. More specifically, the odds of changing towards “Yes” among 18–20-year-olds are about 43% higher than among 16–17-year-olds. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Effects of demographic factors on change in voting behavior. The outcome is binary (changed to no vs. changed to yes). The dots and their labels are the estimates of separate logistic regressions for each variable. The lines around the dots represent uncertainty in the estimates (95% confidence intervals). If these confidence intervals cross 1 (the dotted vertical line), the differences are not statistically significant, meaning we might observe them just by chance. The logarithmic scale (on the x-axis) is used so that in the visualization for the positive and negative odds ratio's to be symmetric (i.e. that 2 is as far away from 1 as is 0.5).](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-vote-change-model-1.pdf){#fig-vote-change-model}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo understand this odds ratio, take @fig-vote_derniers_elections-age-absolute: it shows that among the 16 to 17 year-olds, 285 have changed towards \"No\", while only 238 have changed towards \"Yes\". That makes the odds of changing towards yes for the youngest age group, chosen as the baseline category in the model, `238:285 = ~0.84`. By contrast, among the 18 to 20 year-olds, the odds were `784:658 = ~1.19`. The odds ratio for the 18 to 20 year-olds compares their odds to those of the 16 to 17 year-olds `odds ratio = 1.19:0.84 = 1.4`.\n\n@fig-vote_derniers_elections-age-percentages allows to compare the odds ratios to the percentages for the different age groups. Just like for absolute numbers, the odds ratios can be calculated from the percentages. For example, among the 16 to 17 year-olds, 13.8% have changed towards \"No\", while 11.5% have changed towards \"Yes\", making the odds of changing to \"Yes\", as above, `0.115:0.138 = ~0.83`^[Note that in this illustration, we obtain a slightly different value compared to 0.84 above due to rounding imprecision.]. Among the 18 to 20 year-olds, accordingly, the odds were, as above, `0.174:0.146 = ~1.19`, resulting in the same odds ratio of ~1.4. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Absolute numbers.

In France, the legal voting age is 18. Therefore, the 16 to 17 year olds, at least at the beginning of their service civique (q0/q1), have never been on a voting list before. However, as shown in @fig-vote_derniers_elections-youngest there are 443 volunteers who answered \"No\" at q0/q1 (which technically is true, but not the most specific answer option), and 20 who answered \"Yes\" (probably not reading the question carefully or accidentally clicking on the wrong response).

We used a binary outcome measure (no negative rupture vs. negative rupture) and ran separate logistic regressions with demographic variables (@fig-rupture-model-demographic) a selection of other variables (@fig-rupture-model-other). \n\nAn odds ratio of 1 means that a certain group has the same chance of having a rupture, compared to the baseline group. More than 1 means that this group is more likely to have a rupture. Less than 1 means that this group is less likely to have a rupture. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Demographic factors\n\n@fig-rupture-model-demographic reveals, for example, that older age groups or refugees are less likely to have a rupture, male volunteers and volunteers with a handicap are more likely. The odds ratios can be interpreted as in previous sections. To provide another example, take the variable whether volunteers were part of the \"CŒUR\" or of the \"RELAIS\" program (`type_volontaire`). The odds ratio is 0.9, meaning volunteers of the \"RELAIS\" program were less likely to have a rupture. More specifically, they only had 90% of the odds to breach their contract, compared to volunteers of the \"CŒUR\". \n\nTo get a better sense of this, @fig-rupture-descriptive shows descriptive differences (in percentages) regarding ruputre for some demographic variables, including `type_volontaire`. The odds ratio can be obtained by dividing the odds of the \"RELAIS\" program (0.161:0.834 = 0.193) by the odds of the \"CŒUR\" program (0.181:0.819 = 0.221) program (0.193:0.221 = ~0.9)^[Note that there are slight differences with the reported odds ratio due to rounding errors.].\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Effects of demographic factors on negative ruptures.

Only for the two variables that have been asked at \"q1\": \n\n1. `perception_avenir_num` (Concernant votre avenir, êtes-vous...? \tTrès confiant(e); Assez confiant(e); Peu confiant(e); Pas du tout confiant(e))^[Note `_num` in the variable name stands for 'numeric': we use a numeric version, from \"Pas du tout confiant(e)\" = 1, to \"Très confiant(e)\" = 4.]\n2. `action_individuelle_societe` (En général, pensez-vous que votre action individuelle peut contribuer à changer la société ? \tOui; Pas vraiment; Non)\n\n@fig-rupture-model-other shows how these variables predict rupture. The variable `action_individuelle_societe` is categorical and can be interpreted like the demographic variables in the previous results: one category serves as the reference (omitted) category, and the reported odds ratios represent how the odds of rupture differ relative to that reference. The variable `perception_avenir_num` is numeric (on a scale from 1 to 4). For numeric predictors, the estimated odds ratio indicates how much the odds of rupture change, on average, for each one-unit increase on the scale. For example, the resulting estimate of 1.14 in @fig-rupture-model-other for `perception_avenir_num` means that, on average, a one point increase in confidence about one's future corresponds to 14% higher odds of rupture. In other words, the results suggest that, the more confident volunteers are about their future, the more likely they are to have a rupture, on average. However, @fig-rupture-perception_avenir zooms in on this finding and suggests that this average effect is mostly driven by those volunteers who are \"very confident\". \n\n\n::: {#tbl-rupture-candidates .cell tbl-cap='Candidate variables to evaluating their association with rupture.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{l|l}\n\\hline\nvariable & source\\\\\n\\hline\nperception\\_avenir & q1\\\\\n\\hline\naction\\_individuelle\\_societe & q1\\\\\n\\hline\nprojet\\_avenir\\_concret & q2\\\\\n\\hline\ncomparaison\\_utilite\\_autres & q2\\\\\n\\hline\nfierte & q2\\\\\n\\hline\nconfiance\\_en\\_soi & q2\\\\\n\\hline\nconfiance\\_avenir\\_personnel & q2\\\\\n\\hline\naction\\_individuelle\\_societe & q3\\\\\n\\hline\nimpact\\_situation\\_actuelle & q3\\\\\n\\hline\nintegration & q2\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Effects of demographic factors on negative ruptures.

The results are expressed in odds ratios, which can be interpreted as above: If the odds ratio is *larger than 1*, then a certain group is *more likely* to be represented in the target key program category, compared to all other programs. For example, in @fig-solidarite-aidants-demographic-variables, there are more 18 to 20 year-olds (odds ratio = 1.18, compared to the omitted baseline, 16 to 17 year-olds) in the \"Solidarité Aidants\" program, than in the other programs, on average. If the odds ratio *is below 1*, this means that a certain group is *less likely* to be represented in the target key program category.

In general, the questionnaires could probably be shorter. Fewer questions would probably reduce attrition---if volunteers respond to a very long questionnaire at q1, they might not be motivated to again fill out another very long questionnaire at q2, let alone q3. Including fewer questions would probably also improve the quality of responses, as volunteers might get tired or bored with long questionnaires, thus clicking through very quickly and thoughtlessly at some point. Another option to improve quality in responses could be to add attention checks. However, since volunteers are not forced to take the survey, we can probably assume that those who take it are motivated to fill it out faithfully. \n\nAnother lever for improvement is making the questionnaires at different time points more similar. Asking the same questions at all the different time points allow to track how individual volunteers change throughout their service civique (as in @sec-within-change). \n\nOn a minor note, it might be more interesting to ask volunteers about their voting intentions, rather than their past voting behavior. There is reason to believe that some volunteers do not answer the current question on past behavior as intended (@fig-vote_derniers_elections-youngest). Also, observing change regarding past voting behavior is very dependend on whether elecitons happen to take place for a particular cohort during their year of service civique. \n\n\n\n",
