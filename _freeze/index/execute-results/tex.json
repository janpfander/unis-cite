Who are the volunteers? (@sec-who) \n2. How does the service civique change the volunteers' attitudes and views? (@sec-within-change)\n3. Are there trends between different cohorts of volunteers? (@sec-between-change)\n4. What predicts whether volunteers... \n  - ...end their contract early? (@sec-rupture)\n  - ...are more satisfied ? (@sec-satisfaction)\n  - ...are more confident about their future? (@sec-perception-avenir)\n5. How do volunteers differ between the different programs? \n  - Ciné (@sec-cine)\n  - Ecology (@sec-ecovolonterre)\n\nWe rely on questionnaires collected by Cité-Unis for four different cohorts of volunteers who did their service civique for a year (2020-2021; 2021-2022; 2022-2023; 2023-2024). These questionnaires are very extensive. For the present analyses, we selected a subset of key questions (a full list can be found in the [codebook](codebook.qmd)). Note that this selection of variables was based only on the questionnaire of the first cohort (2020/21). As a result, potentially interesting variables that only appear in later questionnaires will not appear here. \n\n# Who are the volunteers ? {#sec-who}\n\nHere, we just review some demographic variables briefly. An extensive summary table with sample demographics across the different cohorts can be found in [Tables](tables.qmd). \n\n## Geographic location\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nVolunteers came from 80 different departments (see @fig-map-repartition). On average, across the different cohorts, most volunteers came from Bouches-du-Rhône (n = 404), followed by Nord (n = 350) and Seine-Saint-Denis (n = 316). \n\nOverall, there has been a steady increase in volunteers, from 6386 in 20-21 to 7848 in 23-24, and an average increase of 490.4 per year. Since the 20-21 cohort, each departement has on average increased by 26.7. There were 51 departements who saw an increase, and 14 who saw a decrease (see @fig-map-trend). For details on the trend of each departement, see [Tables](tables.qmd). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Répartition des volontaires en France à travers le temps.](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-map-repartition-1.pdf){#fig-map-repartition}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Evolution de recrutement pour la promo de 2023-24 par rapport à 2020-21.](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-map-trend-1.pdf){#fig-map-trend}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Age\n\nAcross all promos, the majority of volunteers is between 18 and 20 years old (@fig-age).\n\n\n::: {#fig-age .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(absolute numbers)](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-age-1.pdf){#fig-age-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(percentages)](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-age-2.pdf){#fig-age-2}\n:::\n\nNumber of volunteers per age group, within the different promos.

However, this analysis is pooled across different cohorts, not all of which would have had the chance to change their voting behavior during their year volunteering, simply because there were no elections.\n\n### Promo 2020-21\n\n\n::: {#fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020 .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Alluvial plot](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020-1.pdf){#fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Percentages](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020-2.pdf){#fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020-2}\n:::\n\nPromo 2020-21.

In fact, 22.9% of volunteers have a \"rupture\", i.e. terminate the contract early. There are various motives for ending one's contract early (see @tbl-rupture). Not all of them are necessarily bad, e.g. \"Embauche en CDD d'au moins 6 mois ou CDI\", and some are outside of the influence of the volunteers, e.g. \"Fin de validité du Titre de Séjour\". For our analyses, we focus only on volunteers who ended their contract early for apparently negative reasons. \n\nTo see whether there are differences in different groups, we ran separate logistic regressions for a selection of variables. The results are shown in @fig-rupture-model.
