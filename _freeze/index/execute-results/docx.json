In @sec-within-change, we look at how the service civique has changed the volunteers' attitudes and views? We then look at several outcomes of interest in detail, namely whether volunteers end their contract early (@sec-rupture), how satisfied they are (@sec-satisfaction), and how confident they are about their future? (@sec-perception-avenir). For these outcomes, we analyze whether there are trends across the different cohorts, and which demographic variables predict them. Finally, in @sec-programs we investigate differences between different programs offered by Cité Unis. \n\nFor these analyses, we rely on questionnaires collected by Cité-Unis for four different cohorts of volunteers who did their service civique for a year (2020-2021; 2021-2022; 2022-2023; 2023-2024). These questionnaires are very extensive. For the present analyses, we selected a subset of key questions (a full list can be found in the [codebook](codebook.qmd))^[Note that, in the process of writing this report, this selection of variables was based only on the questionnaire of the first cohort (2020/21). As a result, potentially interesting variables that only appear in later questionnaires will not appear here.].\n\nBefore diving into the results, a note on caution in interpreting the results presented in is report: Whenever we speak of \"predictions\", that simply means statistical associations---mere observations of differences between groups. This report does **not** provide any evidence that would warrant causal conclusions---answers as to **why** we observe these differences. \n\n# Who are the volunteers ? {#sec-who}\n\nIn this section, we review some demographic variables in detail. An extensive summary table with sample demographics across the different cohorts can be found in [Tables](tables.qmd). \n\n## Geographic location\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nVolunteers came from 80 different departments (see @fig-map-repartition). On average, across the different cohorts, most volunteers came from Bouches-du-Rhône (n = 404), followed by Nord (n = 350) and Seine-Saint-Denis (n = 316). \n\nOverall, there has been a steady increase in volunteers, from 6386 in 20-21 to 7848 in 23-24, and an average increase of 490.4 per year. Since the 20-21 cohort, each departement has on average increased by 26.7. There were 51 departements who saw an increase, and 14 who saw a decrease (see @fig-map-trend). For details on the trend of each departement, see [Tables](tables.qmd). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Répartition des volontaires en France à travers le temps.](index_files/figure-docx/fig-map-repartition-1.png){#fig-map-repartition}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Evolution de recrutement pour la promo de 2023-24 par rapport à 2020-21.](index_files/figure-docx/fig-map-trend-1.png){#fig-map-trend}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Age\n\nAs shown in @fig-age, across all promos, the majority of volunteers is between 18 and 20 years old.

Attrition can can have many causes. Here we distinguish between two explanations: ruptures, i.e. volonteers ending their service civique early (@sec-rupture) and survey fatigue, i.e. volunteers who continue their service civique but do not fill out the questionnaires (@fig-attrition-norupture). \n\n@fig-attrition shows attrition generally, while @fig-attrition-norupture excludes ruptures, thereby giving an estimate of survey fatigue. This latter figure shows that survey fatigue is an issue, but also suggests that there is a slightly positive trend towards reduced survey fatigue: more and more volunteers seem to answering the questionnaires at least for the first two questionnaires (q1 and q2), but less so for the third questionnaire (q3). \n\n\n::: {#fig-attrition .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(absolute numbers)](index_files/figure-docx/fig-attrition-1.png){#fig-attrition-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(percentages)](index_files/figure-docx/fig-attrition-2.png){#fig-attrition-2}\n:::\n\nNumber of volunteers per survey time point.

Note that in the percentage plot, the percentages are relative to all volunteers from the respective promo.\n:::\n\n\n## Voting {#sec-vote}\n\nIn this section, we look at how volunteers have changed regarding their voting behavior. Voting behavior was measured with the question: \"Avez-vous voté lors des dernières élections (locales ou nationales) ?\", which has been asked at time points q1 and q2. @fig-vote_derniers_elections-overview shows that, averaged across all cohorts and time points, the majority of volunteers reports having voted.\n\n\n::: {#fig-vote_derniers_elections-overview .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(absolute numbers)](index_files/figure-docx/fig-vote_derniers_elections-overview-1.png){#fig-vote_derniers_elections-overview-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(percentages)](index_files/figure-docx/fig-vote_derniers_elections-overview-2.png){#fig-vote_derniers_elections-overview-2}\n:::\n\nDistribution of whether volunteers reported having voted or not during the last elections, averaged across time points and cohorts.\n\n:::\n\n\n\nIn the following sections, we investigate how volunteers have changed in answering this question, throughout their service civique. For these analyses, we only consider those volunteers who have answered the question at both time points, q1 and q2. Changes towards \"Yes\" or \"No\" can have happened either from the respective other option, or from the third answer option: \"Vous n'aviez pas l'âge de voter ou vous n'étiez pas inscrit.e sur les listes électorales\", which is abbreviated in the plots below as \"Pas sur les listes\". We look at the different cohorts separately (promo 2020-21, @fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020; promo 2021-22, @fig-vote_derniers_elections-2021; 2022-23, @fig-vote_derniers_elections-2022; 2023-24, @fig-vote_derniers_elections-2023). \n\nThe following sections reveal considerable differences between the cohorts. For example, in 2020-21 and 2021-22, many volunteers reported changes in voting behavior, but in opposite directions: In 2020-21, 24% of volunteers changed towards \"No\", outweighing those who changed to \"Yes\" (6%) by far. Inversely, in 2021-22, 35% of volunteers changed towards \"Yes\", while only 8% changed towards \"No\".\n\nIt is not clear why we observe these differences. One explanation might be that volunteers care more about national elections than local ones (or vice verse). If that is the case, we would expect changes in voting behavior to be dependent on whether there were national or local elections happening during the year of a cohort's service civique.\n\n### Promo 2020-21\n\n\n::: {#fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020 .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Alluvial plot](index_files/figure-docx/fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020-1.png){#fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Percentages](index_files/figure-docx/fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020-2.png){#fig-vote_derniers_elections-2020-2}\n:::\n\nPromo 2020-21.

For this analysis, we look at all cohorts together. The outcome, changes in voting behavior, is binary (changed to no vs. changed to yes)^[I.e. ignoring all volunteers who did not change]. \n\nPlotted on the y-axis are the demographic variables, taken to predict change in voting behavior. For each categorical demographic variable, different levels are shown. For example, for the variable `age_category`, the plot shows three levels: `age_categorie18-20`, `age_categorie21-23`, `age_categorie24-30`. Each of these categories has an estimate (x-axis). These estimates are the results logistic regressions^[For each variable, a separate logistic regression has been run. The estimates from the logistic regression are exponantiated, so that the reported estimates can be interpreted as odds ratios (ORs).]. They indicate how being part of a certain category (e.g. being between 18 and 20 years old) predicts the chances of changing one's voting behavior. The estimates are \"odds ratios\", which can be conceived of as probabilities: An odds ratio of 1 means that this group has the same chance changing to \"no\" as changing to \"yes\". More than 1 means that this group is more likely to change to \"yes\". For example, an odds ratio of 2.0 means twice as likely. Less than 1 means that this group is more likely to change to \"no\". An odds ratio of 0.5 means half as likely. \n\nFor each categorical variable, one category is chosen as the baseline (or reference) category. The odds ratios of all other categories are relative to that baseline. For example, for the variable `age_category`, the category \"16-17\" is not appearing in the graph. That is because this category is the (invisible) baseline category, If the odds ratio for `age_category18–20` is 0.12, this means that 18 to 20 year-olds are considerably less likely to change their vote towards \"Yes\", compared to 16 to 17 year-olds. More specifically, the odds of changing towards “Yes” among 18–20-year-olds are only about 12% of those among 16–17-year-olds. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Effects of demographic factors on change in voting behavior.

That makes the odds of changing towards yes for the youngest age group, chosen as the baseline category in the model, `238:285 = ~0.84`. By contrast, among the 18 to 20 year-olds, the odds were `784:658 = ~1.19`. The odds ratio for the 18 to 20 year-olds compares their odds to those of the 16 to 17 year-olds `odds ratio = 1.19:0.84 = 1.4`. @fig-vote_derniers_elections-age-percentages allows to compare the odds ratios to the percentages for the different age groups.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Absolute numbers.

In France, the legal voting age is 18. Therefore, the 16 to 17 year olds, at least at the beginning of their service civique (q0/q1), have never possible voted legally before. However, as shown in @fig-vote_derniers_elections-youngest there are 443 volunteers who answered \"no\" at q0/q1 (which technically is true, but not the most specific answer option), and 20 who answered \"yes\" (probably not reading the question carefully or accidentally clicking on the wrong response).

The logarithmic scale is used so that in the visualization for the positive and negative odds ratio's to be symmetric (i.e. that 2 is as far away from 1 as is 0.5).](index_files/figure-docx/fig-rupture-model-1.png){#fig-rupture-model}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Percentages of rupture for (allegedly) negative reasons for different groups, for different variables.](index_files/figure-docx/fig-rupture-descriptive-1.png){#fig-rupture-descriptive}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHow to make sense of the odds ratios?

How to interpret the coefficients? For categorical variables, a baseline has been chosen in the model (refer to the codebook to see the omitted baseline category). The estimate shown in the graph is how much, compared to this baseline, satisfaction increases or decreases (on a scale from 1 to 4).
