(@sec-confidence)\n5. How do volunteers differ between the different programs? \n  - Ciné (@sec-cine)\n  - Ecology \n  - Coeur vs. Relais (@sec-coeur-vs-relais)\n\nWe rely on questionnaires collected by Cité-Unis for four different cohorts of volunteers who did their service civique for a year (2020-2021; 2021-2022; 2022-2023; 2023-2024). These questionnaires are very extensive. For the present analyses, we selected a subset of key questions (a full list can be found in the [codebook](codebook.qmd)). Note that this selection of variables was based only on the questionnaire of the first cohort (2020/21). As a result, potentially interesting variables that only appear in later questionnaires will not appear here. \n\n# Who are the volunteers ? {#sec-who}\n\nHere, we just review some demographic variables briefly. An extensive summary table with sample demographics across the different cohorts can be found in [Tables](tables.qmd). \n\n## Geographic location\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nVolunteers came from 80 different departments (see @fig-map-repartition). On average, across the different cohorts, most volunteers came from Bouches-du-Rhône (n = 404), followed by Nord (n = 350) and Seine-Saint-Denis (n = 316). \n\nOverall, there has been a steady increase in volunteers, from 6386 in 20-21 to 7848 in 23-24, and an average increase of 490.4 per year. Since the 20-21 cohort, each departement has on average increased by 26.7. There were 51 departements who saw an increase, and 14 who saw a decrease (see @fig-map-trend). For details on the trend of each departement, see [Tables](tables.qmd). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Répartition des volontaires en France à travers le temps.](index_files/figure-html/fig-map-repartition-1.svg){#fig-map-repartition width=624}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Evolution de recrutement pour la promo de 2023-24 par rapport à 2020-21.](index_files/figure-html/fig-map-trend-1.svg){#fig-map-trend width=624}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Age\n\n\n\n## Education\n\n## Sex\n\n# How have volunteers changed their attitudes? {#sec-within-change}\n\nFirst, this analysis is restricted by attrition, i.e. volunteers dropping out of the surveys over time (see @fig-attrition). Second, there are only two questions that volunteers of the same promo have been asked at different time points (@tbl-within-variables). @fig-vote_derniers_elections shows all volunteers who answered at both time points (q1 and q2), with either \"yes\" or \"no\". This descriptive analysis suggests that the service civique did not have an impact on voting behavior, on average. However, this analysis is pooled across different cohorts, not all of which would have had the chance to change their voting behavior during their year volunteering, simply because there were no elections. @fig-action_individuelle_societe shows changes in volunteers perception on whether their individual action can contribute to changing society. Descriptively, there is no clear positive or negative trend either.\n\n\n::: {#fig-attrition .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(absolute numbers)](index_files/figure-html/fig-attrition-1.svg){#fig-attrition-1 width=624}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(percentages)](index_files/figure-html/fig-attrition-2.svg){#fig-attrition-2 width=624}\n:::\n\nNumber of volunteers per survey time point.

Note that this analysis considers only answers of volunteers who answered at *both* time points.\n:::\n\n\n# Are there trends between different cohorts of volunteers?{#sec-between-change}\n\nThere are many possible variables to look at regarding between-cohort differences. As an example, @fig-satisfaction shows how different cohorts evaluated their satisfaction with the service civique. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Satisfaction between cohorts.](index_files/figure-html/fig-satisfaction-1.svg){#fig-satisfaction width=624}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Predictions\n\nFor all predictions, we rely only on volunteers from the \"Coeur\" program. Note that all predicitons here are just statistical associations--they tell us about differences we observe, but they do not provide proof for causal conclusions on why we observe these differences. \n\n## What predicts whether volunteers end their contract early (rupture)? {#sec-rupture}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nNot all volunteers work until the end of their contract. In fact, 22.9% of volunteers have a \"rupture\", i.e. terminate the contract early. There are various motives for ending one's contract early (see @tbl-rupture). Not all of them are necessarily bad, e.g. \"Embauche en CDD d'au moins 6 mois ou CDI\", and some are outside of the influence of the volunteers, e.g. \"Fin de validité du Titre de Séjour\". For our analyses, we focus only on volunteers who ended their contract early for apparently negative reasons. \n\nTo see whether there are differences in different groups, we ran separate logistic regressions for a selection of variables. The results are shown in @fig-rupture-model. Because the magnitude of the odds ratios (OR) are not straightforward to interpret, @fig-rupture-descriptive shows descriptive differences in contract terminations for some groups. \n\n\n::: {#tbl-rupture .cell tbl-cap='Different motives for \"rupture\" and whether they were coded as negative, positive, or external reasons.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> motif_rupture </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> rupture_valence </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> n </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 01 - Abandon de poste </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> negative </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1444 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 02 - Faute grave d'une des parties </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> negative </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 455 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 03 - Force majeure </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> raisons externes </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 280 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 04 - Embauche en CDD d'au moins 6 mois ou CDI </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> positive </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 621 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 05 - Embauche en CDD moins de 6 mois </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> positive </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 383 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 06 - Commun accord entre les parties </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> negative </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2761 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 07 - Le volontaire n'a jamais pris son poste </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> negative </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 13 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 08 - Retrait de l'agrément de la structure d'accueil </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> negative </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 09 - Reprise d'études </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> negative </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 412 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 10 - Fin de validité du Titre de Séjour </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> raisons externes </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 39 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> NA </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> NA </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 21549 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Effects of demographic factors on negative rupture. Coefficients are the results of separate logistic regressions for each variable. For categorical variables, a baseline has been chosen in the model (refer to the codebook to see the omitted baseline category). Each bar or dot in the chart shows how a factor (like age, gender, or education) relates to the chance of a rupture. An odds ratio of 1 means that this group has the same chance of a rupture as the baseline group. More than 1 means that this group is more likely to have a rupture. For example, an odds ratio of 2.0 means twice as likely. Less than 1 means that this group is less likely to have a rupture. An odds ratio of 0.5 means half as likely. The lines show uncertainty (confidence intervals). If they cross 1, the difference might not be meaningful (in this case, the result is not statistically significant).
